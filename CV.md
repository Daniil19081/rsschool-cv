**hello everyone, I always wanted to become a programmer, but somehow I didn't have enough strength for it and everything seemed very difficult, but this time I am determined and I want to learn something new for myself and develop in this direction**
**I don't have the skills and experience in this field yet, but I really hope to acquire them and become successful in this direction**
**I have a higher education, graduated from Rostov University, but in a specialty unrelated to this field of activity. I speak English at a low level, although now such technologies that I think it has a strong effect on life activity. If necessary, I can learn it.**
